# CSC452-Phase2

### --- Testcase Report --- ###

### Test 08
This test's only difference is the order of joins, thus it has to deal 
with an ordering difference when unblocking processes, so it is simply an 
implementation difference. Because we unblock every process instead of just
the first one on release. This way, they race to see who will quit first, which
causes the ordering difference. 

### Test 13 
The output is not an exact match, but it does follow the around 100k requirement and 
the around 100k more requirement.

### Test 25
This test's only difference is the order of joins, thus it has to deal 
with an ordering difference when unblocking processes, so it is simply an 
implementation difference. Because we unblock every process instead of just
the first one on release. This way, they race to see who will quit first, which
causes the ordering difference. 

### Test 30
This test's only difference is the order of joins, thus it has to deal 
with an ordering difference when unblocking processes, so it is simply an 
implementation difference. Because we unblock every process instead of just
the first one on release. This way, they race to see who will quit first, which
causes the ordering difference. 

### Test 31
This test's only difference is the order of joins, thus it has to deal 
with an ordering difference when unblocking processes, so it is simply an 
implementation difference. Because we unblock every process instead of just
the first one on release. This way, they race to see who will quit first, which
causes the ordering difference. 

### Test 46

implementation difference. Because we unblock every process instead of just
